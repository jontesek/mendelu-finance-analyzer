WORDSTAT
Actually, sentiment is not measured with those two lists of words and word patterns but instead with two sets of rules that attempt to take into account negations that may precede those words. For example, negative sentiment is measured by using the following two rules:

1.    Negative words not preceded by a negation (no, not never) within three words in the same sentence.
2.    Positive words preceded by a negation within three words in the same sentence.

Positive sentiment is measured in a similar way by looking for positive words not preceded by a negation as well as negative terms following a negation.

Every value is reported three times, one for each dimension, prefixed with V for valence, A for arousal, and D for dominance.
For each word, we report the overall mean (Mean.Sum), standard deviation (SD.Sum), and number of contributing ratings (Rat.Sum).
